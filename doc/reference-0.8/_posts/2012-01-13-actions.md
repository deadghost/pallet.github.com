The actions provide the basic primitives for pallet.  These actions can be
composed in plan functions to implement your configuration and operational
requirements.

## Direct Script Execution

Sometimes pallet's other actions will not suffice for what you would like to
achieve, so the
`exec-script`
actions allow you to execute arbitrary script.

``` clojure
(exec-script* "ls some/path")
(exec-script (ls "some/path"))
(exec-checked-script "List some path" (ls "some/path"))
```

The
[`exec-script*`](/pallet/api/0.8/pallet.actions.html#var-exec-script*)
function will execute any bash script you pass it as a string.

[`exec-script`](/pallet/api/0.8/pallet.actions.html#var-exec-script)
is similar, but runs scripts written in pallet's
[embedded script DSL, stevedore](/doc/reference/0.8/script).

[`exec-checked-script`](/pallet/api/0.8/pallet.actions.html#var-exec-checked-script)
also uses stevedore, but will raise an error if the script exits with a non-zero
exit code.

## Simple File Management

Files can be managed using the
[`file`](/pallet/api/0.8/pallet.actions.html#var-file),
[`symbolic-link`](/pallet/api/0.8/pallet.actions.html#var-symbolic-link), and
[`fifo`](/pallet/api/0.8/pallet.actions.html#var-fifo) actions.

``` clojure
(file "some/path" :owner "user", :group "group", :mode "0644")
(symbolic-link "original/path" "link/path")
(fifo "some/path" :owner "user", :group "group", :mode "0644")
```

## Simple Directory Management

Directories can be managed using the
[`directory`](/pallet/api/0.8/pallet.actions.html#var-directory), and
[`directories`](/pallet/api/0.8/pallet.actions.html#var-directories) actions.

``` clojure
(directory "some/path" :owner "user", :path true)
(directories ["some/path" "other/path"] :owner "root")
```

## File Contents

File contents can be manipulated with
[`remote-file`](/pallet/api/0.8/pallet.actions.html#var-remote-file),
[`remote-directory`](/pallet/api/0.8/pallet.actions.html#var-remote-directory),
[`rsync-directory`](/pallet/api/0.8/pallet.actions.html#var-rsync-directory) and
[`sed`](/pallet/api/0.8/pallet.actions.html#var-sed).

``` clojure
(remote-file "some/path" :content "Some content", :owner "user")
(remote-directory "some/path" :local-file "my.tar.gz")
(rsync-directory "local/path" "remote/path")
```

Note that `remote-directory` can unpack archives.

## Packages

Packages can be controlled via
[`package`](/pallet/api/0.8/pallet.actions.html#var-package),
[`packages`](/pallet/api/0.8/pallet.actions.html#var-packages),
[`package-manager`](/pallet/api/0.8/pallet.actions.html#var-package-manager),
[`package-source`](/pallet/api/0.8/pallet.actions.html#var-package-source),
[`add-rpm`](/pallet/api/0.8/pallet.actions.html#var-add-rpm), and
[`minimal-packages`](/pallet/api/0.8/pallet.actions.html#var-minimal-packages).

``` clojure
(package "some/path")
(packages :aptitiude ["git-core"] :yum ["git"])
(package-manager :update)
(package-source
 "Partner" :aptitude {:url "http://archive.canonical.com/" :scopes ["partner"]})
(minimal-packages)
```

## Users and Groups

Users and groups can be created and removed with
[`user`](/pallet/api/0.8/pallet.actions.html#var-user) and
[`group`](/pallet/api/0.8/pallet.actiona.html#var-group).

``` clojure
(user "tomcat" :system true, :shell "/bin/false", :group "tomcat")
(group "tomcat")
```

## Services

Init style services can be controlled with
[`service`](/pallet/api/0.8/pallet.actions.html#var-service), and
[`init-script`](/pallet/api/0.8/pallet.actions.html#var-init-script).

``` clojure
(service "tomcat" :action :restart)
```

# Action Options

By default actions are run using `sudo` to the root user.  You can modify this
by using action options:

``` clojure
(require '[pallet.action :refer [with-action-options]])
(with-action-options {:script-dir "/var/log/app"}
  (remote-file "some/path" :content "Some content", :owner "user"))
```

Available options are:

`:script-dir`
sets the directory the action will run in

`:script-prefix`
sets the prefix for the command to run the action.  This defaults to `:sudo`.
At present, any other option, e.g. `:no-sudo` will run without sudo.  See
[pallet.script-builder/prefix](/pallet/api/0.8/pallet.script-builder.html#var-prefix)
if you wish to add your own prefix commands, to run in a chroot, for example.

`:script-env`
takes a map of environment variables and values to set for the action.

`:sudo-user`
sets the user that `sudo` will be called with (when `:script-prefix` is `:sudo`,
the default).

`:new-login-after-action`
forces a new login session to be used for subsequent actions (i.e. after the
completion of each action.
