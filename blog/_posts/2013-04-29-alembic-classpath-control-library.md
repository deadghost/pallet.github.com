summary: Alembic allows you to control the classpath of your clojure REPL

Working at the REPL in clojure flows well until you need to add a dependency.
The edit `project.clj` and restart your REPL dance is time consuming, and throws
away the state of your REPL.

Chas Emerick's [pomegranate](https://github.com/cemerick/pomegranate) provides
all the functionality required to add dependencies to your classpath in a
running JVM instance, but comes at the cost of introducing a boatload of
dependencies that may conflict with your project's own dependencies.

[Alembic](https://github.com/pallet/alembic) is a new library that solves this
by using [classlojure](https://github.com/flatland/classlojure) to put
[pomegranate](https://github.com/cemerick/pomegranate) (and lein as a whole, in
fact), into a separate classloader.  It then uses the same
[dynapath](https://github.com/tobias/dynapath) library used by pomegranate, to
add the resolved dependencies into your classpath.  This greatly cuts down the
chance of conflict, and will all but eliminate it if we can remove the `useful`
dependency from classlojure.

To use Alembic with nREPL or any other clojure REPL, you will need to add
Alembic to you development dependencies.  For a leiningen based project, you can
do this by adding it to the `:dependencies` vector of the `:dev` profile in
`project.clj`.

``` clojure
:profiles {:dev {:dependencies [[alembic "0.1.0"]]}}
```

You can enable Alembic on all you projects, by adding it to the `:dependencies`
vector of the `:user` profile in `~/.lein/profiles.clj`.

The main function in alembic today is `distill`, which adds a dependency to your
classpath.  For example, to add `tools.logging`, you would call `distill` like
this:

``` clojure
(require 'alembic.still)
(alembic.still/distill '[org.clojure/tools.logging "0.2.0"])
```

Transitive dependencies are of course added as well, which brings up the
possibility of version conflicts.  Alembic will not add any new version of a
dependency if it is already on the classpath, and will warn about the possible
version conflict.

The `dependencies-added` function can be used to retrieve a sequence of the
dependencies you have added, so you can add them to your `project.clj` as
needed.

[Alembic](https://github.com/pallet/alembic) is in its infancy.  Having lein
running in a classloader, off to the side as it were, will probably enable lots
more goodies.  Look forward to your comments and suggestions, either in the
project's [issues](https://github.com/pallet/alembic), or on the
[clojure-tools](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/clojure-tools)
google group.
