We have added a way to track significant documentation changes. From
now on, every time a document is added or significantly updated, we
will post an update on the [Documentation Changes](/doc/changes) page
and the corresponding [RSS feed](/doc/changes/atom.xml).

We hope this will help you keep up to date with the documentation.
