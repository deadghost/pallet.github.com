# PalletOps Services

Leverage our team of experts to complement and enhance your team for
all your automation project, by taking advantage of the range of
consulting and training services we offer, and get your team up to
speed and on the path to success.

## Proof of Concept Services

If you are a looking to evaluate Pallet as a solution for your
automation needs, this offering is for you. PalletOps engineers will
work with your team to build a Proof of Concept (PoC) to help you
verify how Pallet products fit with your infrastructure and goals.

Typically, PoC services involve:

 - __Basic training for the team__: A PalletOps engineer will lead an
      online training session covering the architecture and features
      Pallet, followed by an introduction to its programming model.
 - __Joint Architecture Overview & Planning__: A PalletOps engineer
      will participate in the setting of the goals for the PoC, and
      scoping, architecting and planing its development.
 - __Joint or Sole Development of the PoC__: At this point we can either
      develop the PoC project on your behalf, or become part of a
      joint team to develop it.
 - __Demo and Q&A__: The final step is to review that the project has
      met all the PoC goals, and answer any question that you might
      have about it.

      project to provide guidance and help identify potential
      roadblocks.

      our Support services for both development questions and bug
      fixes.
