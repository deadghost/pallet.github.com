Crates are functions that encapsulate some unit of configuration or
administration. Every crate must take a first argument as a session map, and
must return an updated session map. Crates can take other arguments.

## Composing existing crates
The simplest way of creating a crate is to compose it from existing crates or actions.

``` clojure
(require 'pallet.action.package)
(require 'pallet.crate.git)
(require 'pallet.crate.tomcat)

(defn my-simple-config
  [session]
  (->
    session
    (pallet.action.package/package "maven2")
    (pallet.crate.git/git)
    (pallet.crate.tomcat/tomcat)))
```

## Parameters

## Delayed Arguments

## Templates

## Extending Pallet's Actions

### Creating actions
`defaction` can be used to define script producing functions, that can then
be called in crates.

### Aggregate action

`defaggregate` can be used to define actions that collect arguments over
multiple invocations and emit a action based on the aggregated arguments.
This is used in the sudoers crate, for example, to emit /etc/sudoers.

### Local actions
`def-clj-action` defines a action that will be run on the local machine.
