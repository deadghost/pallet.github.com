A phase specifies a sequence of [actions](/doc/reference/0.8/actions) or
[plan functions](/doc/reference/0.8/crates) to be executed.  A phase can be
defined as part of a [server-spec](/doc/reference/0.8/node-types), or inline in
a [`configure` or `lift` invocation](/doc/reference/0.8/operations), using the
`plan-fn` macro.

## `plan-fn` macro

A plan function is just a plain clojure function.

The [`pallet.api/plan-fn`](/pallet/api/0.8/pallet.api#var-plan-fn) macro is a
convenience for defining a plan function.  In the following example, the two
server-spec definitions are functionally equivalent.

``` clojure
(require '[pallet.api :refer [group-spec node-spec plan-fn server-spec]])
(require '[pallet.actions :refer [package]])

(server-spec
  :phases {:configure (plan-fn (package "curl"))})

(server-spec
  :phases {:configure (fn [] (package "curl"))})
```

The `plan-fn` can also be named, in which case the name is used to provide
context which is used in the log output.

## :bootstrap

The `:bootstrap` phase is applied whenever pallet starts a new node.

## :settings

The `:settings` phase is applied first, before any other phase. This phase is
intended to provide configuration settings only, and to have no side-effects on
the nodes.

## :configure

The `:configure` phase is applied by default by both the
[`converge` and `lift` operations](/doc/reference/0.8/operations).

## Inline phases

The `:phase` keyword in [`lift`](/pallet/api/0.8/pallet.api#var-lift) and
[`converge`](/pallet/api/0.8/pallet.api#var-converge) can be used to carry out
ad-hoc configuration or administration tasks. In this example we install `curl`
on all running `mytag` nodes.

``` clojure
(require '[pallet.api :refer [group-spec node-spec lift plan-fn server-spec]])
(require '[pallet.actions :refer [package]])
(require '[pallet.configure :refer [compute-service]])

(lift (group-spec "mytag")
      :phase (plan-fn (package "curl"))
      :compute (pallet.configure/compute-service))
```
