Last year we attended [Clojure Conj](http://clojureconj.org) and
[Chas Emerick](http://cemerick.com) interviewed us for his
[MostlyLazy podcast](http://mostlylazy.com). Chas published
[this interview today](http://mostlylazy.com/2012/02/03/episode-0-0-4-antoni-batchelli-and-hugo-duncan-at-clojure-conj-2011/),
and he has also done a terrific job at summarizing the topics covered
in the accompanying blog post.

[Head over to Mostly Lazy](http://mostlylazy.com/2012/02/03/episode-0-0-4-antoni-batchelli-and-hugo-duncan-at-clojure-conj-2011/) to listen to this 23min interview.
