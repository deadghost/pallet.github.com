The actions provide the basic primitives for pallet.  These actions can be
composed in crate functions to implement your configuration and operational
requirements.

See the [API](/pallet/api/0.7/index.html) documentation
for details. In these examples, the first `session` argument is assumed to be
threaded, and is elided.

## Direct Script Execution

Sometimes pallet's other actions will not suffice for what you would like to
achieve, so the
[`exec-script`](/pallet/api/0.7/pallet.action.exec-script.html#var-exec-script)
actions allow you to execute arbitrary script.

``` clojure
(exec-script* "ls some/path")
(exec-script (ls "some/path"))
(exec-checked-script "List some path" (ls "some/path"))
```


## Simple File Management

Files can be managed using the
[`file`](/pallet/api/0.7/pallet.action.file.html#var-file),
[`symbolic-link`](/pallet/api/0.7/pallet.action.file.html#var-symbolic-link),
and [`fifo`](/pallet/api/0.7/pallet.action.file.html#var-fifo) actions.

``` clojure
(file "some/path" :owner "user", :group "group", :mode "0644")
(symbolic-link "original/path" "link/path")
(fifo "some/path" :owner "user", :group "group", :mode "0644")
```

## Simple Directory Management

Directories can be managed using the
[`directory`](/pallet/api/0.7/pallet.action.directory.html#var-directory), and
[`directories`](/pallet/api/0.7/pallet.action.directory.html#var-directories)
actions.

``` clojure
(directory "some/path" :owner "user", :path true)
(directories ["some/path" "other/path"] :owner "root")
```

## File Contents

File contents can be manipulated with
[`remote-file`](/pallet/api/0.7/pallet.action.remote-file.html#var-remote-file),
[`remote-directory`](/pallet/api/0.7/pallet.action.remote-directory.html#var-remote-directory),
[`rsync-directory`](/pallet/api/0.7/pallet.action.rsync.html#var-rsync-directory)
and [`sed`](/pallet/api/0.7/pallet.action.file.html#var-sed).

``` clojure
(remote-file "some/path" :content "Some content", :owner "user")
(remote-directory "some/path" :local-file "my.tar.gz")
(rsync-directory "local/path" "remote/path")
```

Note that `remote-directory` can unpack archives.

## Packages

Packages can be controlled via
[`package`](/pallet/api/0.7/pallet.action.package.html#var-package),
[`packages`](/pallet/api/0.7/pallet.action.package.html#var-packages),
[`package-manager`](/pallet/api/0.7/pallet.action.package.html#var-package-manager),
[`package-source`](/pallet/api/0.7/pallet.action.package.html#var-package-source),
[`add-rpm`](/pallet/api/0.7/pallet.action.package.html#var-add-rpm), and
[`minimal-packages`](/pallet/api/0.7/pallet.action.package.html#var-minimal-packages).

``` clojure
(package "some/path")
(packages :aptitiude ["git-core"] :yum ["git"])
(package-manager :update)
(package-source
 "Partner" :aptitude {:url "http://archive.canonical.com/" :scopes ["partner"]})
(minimal-packages)
```

## Users and Groups

Users and groups can be created and removed with
[`user`](/pallet/api/0.7/pallet.action.user.html#var-user) and
[`group`](/pallet/api/0.7/pallet.action.user.html#var-group).

``` clojure
(user "tomcat" :system true, :shell "/bin/false", :group "tomcat")
(group "tomcat")
```

## Services

Init style services can be controlled with
[`service`](/pallet/api/0.7/pallet.action.service.html#var-service), and
[`init-script`](/pallet/api/0.7/pallet.action.service.html#var-init-script).

``` clojure
(service "tomcat" :action :restart)
```
