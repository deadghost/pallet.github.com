<p>We are trying to get together with all the Pallet users and lurkers that exist in the Clojure community a the <a href="http://clojure-conj.org/">Clojure/Conj</a> this November. We still don't know the details on where and at what date/time we'll be able to meet, but we will meet for sure.</p>
<p>We've setup a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Pallet-Users-Group/events/38415062/">Pallet Users Meetup</a> to register RSVPs and also to communicate the specifics of this meetup once they're settled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're looking forward meeting you all!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Pallet-Users-Group/events/38415062/">Please RSVP</a> so we know you're interested and we can plan accordingly!</p>
