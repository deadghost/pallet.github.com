Developing cloud applications is slow. The build, deploy, test cycle
is slow because the deploy part usually involves installing many
packages in many servers. It is also slow because of the need to
coordinate infrastructure changes with code changes, and the process
this usually involves for synchronizing the changes in all the
environments (development, integration, QA, production).

Why Cloud Development is Slow
-----------------------------
- Deploying to multiple machines
- Limited amount of tests environments, hard to keep them up-to-date
- Complexity of ensuring an clean environment
- Hard to assert the state of the test environment

Using VMs for cloud development is not something new
----------------------------------------------------
- Explore vagrant and how it is used with chef/puppet

Ephemeral VMs to the Rescue
---------------------------
- What are they
- How to use with something like pallet

### External Resources

How To Get Started
